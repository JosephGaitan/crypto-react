# crypto-react
Built using Reactjs, JavaScript and Styled Components (CSS). 
I created my own custom hooks to modify the url so I can get different information from the API. 
This project shows you real-time information about the cryptocurrency market, it will also show you the price of the crypto-asset in your local currency. 
All this information is gotten from APIs so you will always have updated information.
